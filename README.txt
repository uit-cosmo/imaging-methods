# phantom
Some diverse python codes I have developed and use to analyze APD, Phantom and synthetic blob data. As for now this is
quite experimental and not well tested. General functions are located in the phantom folder, including:
- cond_av: Code for two-dimensional conditional averaging
- show_data: Diverse plotting functions
- utils: Other functions

Top level files have been used to analyze different shots and synthetic data generated with blobmodel.
